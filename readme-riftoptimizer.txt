put this in your rift wizard / mods subfolder

if you want to print out profiling data run the game with the "whole_game_profiling" commandline flag
(note that doing so makes the game run slower)

code by anotak
except for patch_general function by ceph3us, and RiftWizard importing by trung

partially based on code from Rift Wizard by Dylan White, also thanks for discussion of the game's code and implementing some changes from this mod into Rift Wizard itself.

big thanks to snelaine, ivy melinda, ceph3us, and jazz mickle for feedback, support, and advice

additional thanks to ludwig2011 for testing
